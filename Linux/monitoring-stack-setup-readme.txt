This playbook sets up a monitoring stack consisting of Prometheus for monitoring, Grafana for visualization, and Node Exporter for collecting system metrics. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Installs the required packages (wget and unzip) for downloading and extracting the monitoring tools.
Downloads and unpacks the Prometheus binary archive.
Configures Prometheus using a Jinja2 template (prometheus.yml.j2).
Copies a systemd unit file for Prometheus and starts the Prometheus service.
Downloads the Grafana DEB package.
Installs Grafana using the downloaded DEB package.
Configures Grafana using a Jinja2 template (grafana.ini.j2).
Defines a handler to restart Grafana when its configuration changes.
Downloads and unpacks the Node Exporter binary archive.
Copies a systemd unit file for Node Exporter and starts the Node Exporter service.
The configuration files for Prometheus (prometheus.yml.j2) and Grafana (grafana.ini.j2) are not included in this playbook but would typically be defined as Jinja2 templates. These templates allow you to customize the configurations based on variables or other logic.

The systemd unit files for Prometheus (prometheus.service) and Node Exporter (node_exporter.service) are also not included but would need to be created and copied to the /etc/systemd/system/ directory on the target hosts.

This playbook assumes that the target hosts are running a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu) and uses the apt package manager for installing packages. Modifications may be required for other distributions or package managers.

With this setup, Prometheus will collect metrics from Node Exporter (and potentially other sources), and Grafana can be used to visualize and analyze the collected metrics through dashboards and graphs.

Note that this is a basic setup, and you may need to customize the configurations and add additional data sources, exporters, or alerting rules depending on your specific monitoring requirements.
